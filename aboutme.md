👋 Hi, I’m Mo safarpour
PhD Candidate in AI • Data Science & Mining • Interpretable Machine Learning
Google Scholar ORCID GitHub

🔍 I work at the intersection of data mining, statistical learning, and interpretable AI — especially with fuzzy-rough hybrid systems.
🧠 I develop label-agnostic feature selection methods grounded in fuzzy equivalence and sigmoid similarity for transparent, data-driven discovery.
🔓 I practice open science: all my code and data are archived on Zenodo with persistent DOIs.

🐢 “Move like the turtle: calm, steady, unstoppable.”
